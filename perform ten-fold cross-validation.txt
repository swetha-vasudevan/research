use the METABRIC dataset, design three different CNNs for all
the three modalities of data. These CNNs
are termed as CNN-Clinical, CNN-Expr, and
CNN-CNA for clinical, gene expression and
CNA dataset, respectively.

Train the CNNs are on each uni-modal dataset individually by setting the AUC value
as the performance measurement criteria.
Extract either hidden features or the predicted output from each of the trained CNN
and concatenate these features to form the stacked feature set.

Pass stacked features extracted from stage one as the input to stage two of the model.
SVM (support vector machine), RF (random forest), NB(Naive Bayes) and LR(Logistic Regression) are used in stage two of the model one by one and performance is measured for each one of them.

Perform ten-fold cross-validation
to evaluate the proposed model. divide the 1980 patients in our
dataset randomly into 10 subsets, out of which
9 subsets should be merged and considered as the training set
while remaining one subset should be regarded as the testing set
one after the other. The further training set should be divided into
80% training set and 20% validation set. Firstly, 
train individual CNN for each modality of data and fix the
optimal parameters by using AUC value as the criterion.
Secondly,  extract the outputs from either the hidden
layer or output layer of each CNN and combine them to
form the stacked feature set. At last, these stacked features
should be passed to stage two of the stacked-based model, which
itself is a machine learning model such as SVM, RF, Naive
Bayes and LR.

Predict outputs of different DNN models concatenated together to form stacked features.
The weights from the hidden layer (the layer before
the output layer) of each DNN model should be multiplied
by their respective AUC values and then concatenated together to form stacked features.
The predicted outputs of different DNN models should be
multiplied by their respective AUC values and then
concatenated together to form stacked features.
